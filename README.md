# WoWDevelopment
World of Warcraft Syntax Highlight and Auto-Completion for Sublime Text 2/3.

# Features:

* Full API sytax highlighting for lua, xml and toc files
* Global finder build system, which finds any global variables with detailed information for the current lua file.

# Installation:
* Download the package (remove the -master suffix), and copy the folder into your Sublime Text 2/3 Packages folder.
* Open any of the supported file and set the syntax for the selected file: WoWDevelopment -> WoW Lua, WoW TOC, WoW XML.

The autocomplete is based on scopes, so no settings are neccessary.
